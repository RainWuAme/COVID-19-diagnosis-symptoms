## Overview
COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. It is important to be aware of the common symptoms of COVID-19, in order to facilitate early detection and treatment.

We have included all COVID-19 related symptoms in categories of "General", "Ear, Nose, and Throat", "Respiratory", "Gastrointestinal and Hepatic", "Cardiovascular", "Neurological", "Musculoskeletal", "Dermatological", "Ophthalmology", and "Genitourinary".

## ICD-10 and ICD-10 NW
We have provided the standard ICD-10 code for each symptom. For those symptoms with the same ICD-10 codes, we have created our own code, ICD-10 NW, to ensure that each symptom has a unique code.
